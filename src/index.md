This is Fernando.

Former HSE specialist, now a software developer.
I changed careers in 2019, being 32. So, as I started late, I'm trying to move fast.

Since then I've been learning heaps of stuff. And I've been exploring ways to keep doing it.
This blog is one of them. Hopefully it will help me to shape and organize my notes (I have thousands of them).

We'll see how it goes. I'll keep you posted.
