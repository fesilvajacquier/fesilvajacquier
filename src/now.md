Important things first, right?

I am enjoying life with my wife, Sonia.

I play football with friends and train. To keep everything in balance, I am also constantly looking for new flavours, new places to eat and new things to cook (Just an euphemism to say that I like, a lot,  to eat, a lot).

I'm currently working at:

- [Boxful](https://www.boxful.io){:target="_blank"} as a tech lead.
- [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/){:target="_blank"} as a teacher.
- a couple of start ups as a consultant / technical advisor.

Also, I dedicate some time to whoever thinks they can benefit from it. If you think I can help you, [lets have a one on one](https://calendly.com/fesilvajacquier/30min){:target="_blank"}.
