Today I struggled with **Active Storage** variants in a Rails project.
Of course the problem was not **Active Storage**.

### The Problem

As I set out to implement **Active Storage** variants for image resizing in a **Ruby on Rails** app, I referred to the official [Rails guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html) for guidance. However, there was a hitch. The version referenced in the guides was newer than the one (v6.1.x) I was using in my project.

### The Frustration Mounts

I attempted to use **Active Storage** variants, but things didn't go as expected. I was getting errors that did not make much sense, and I couldn't seem to identify the root cause. I revisited the guides multiple times, fearing I had overlooked something critical. However, my efforts didn't yield any positive results.

### The Lightbulb Moment

Eventually, it occurred to me that I needed to ensure I was referencing the correct version of the documentation. I've learned the hard way that sometimes it's best to check the most apparent things before diving deep into complex troubleshooting.

To address this, I decided to directly explore the **Active Storage** gem's source code for the version I was using in my project (v6.1.x). This process is quite straightforward with the `bundle open activestorage` command. By opening the gem in my editor, I gained insight into the specific `README`` and source code relevant to my version.

### The Eureka Moment

This simple action turned out to be a game-changer. As I delved into the source code and `README` for my version, the puzzle pieces fell into place. I discovered that certain options and methods behaved slightly differently in my version compared to the newer one documented in the Rails guides.

### The Resolution

Armed with this newfound knowledge, I made the necessary adjustments in my code, and voilÃ  - no more errors.

### Key Takeaways

- **Verify the Basics First:** Don't underestimate the importance of checking fundamental aspects. Ensure you're using the correct version of the documentation or libraries to avoid unnecessary confusion.

- **Turn to the Source Code:** When uncertainty arises with your dependencies, referring directly to the source code can be incredibly valuable. It's the most reliable way to understand how things are meant to function, especially when dealing with version discrepancies.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
