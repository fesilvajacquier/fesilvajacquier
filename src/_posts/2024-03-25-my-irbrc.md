## Introduction

Every single day (I open my computer) I use a **Ruby** REPL.
And since `irb` was _gemified_ it is moving forward fast and getting better and better.

I am trying to invest some time to get used to it and make it more useful for me.
Out of the box it provides a great experience. At some point I might write about the things I use or appreciate the most.
For example, the [Don't echo an expression's result when it ends with a semicolon](https://github.com/ruby/irb/pull/669){:target="_blank"} that is extremly useful when querying something that might return thousands of records (ie: `User.where(stauts: :active)`).

## The file

```ruby
begin
  require "rubygems"

  gems = %w[
    amazing_print
  ]

  if defined?(Rails)
    require "bundler/inline"

    gemfile(true) do
      source "https://rubygems.org"
      gems.each do |gem_name|
        gem gem_name
      end
    end

  else
    gems.each do |gem_name|
      next if Gem::Specification.find_all_by_name(gem_name).any?

      system("gem install #{gem_name}")
    end
  end

  require "amazing_print"

  IRB.conf[:PROMPT_MODE] = :SIMPLE
  IRB.conf[:AUTO_INDENT] = true

  AmazingPrint.defaults = {
    indent: 2,
    sort_keys: true,
  }

  AmazingPrint.irb!

rescue LoadError => e
  puts "Error loading console: #{e}"
end
```

## What it does

As I mentioned, I like `irb` as it is.
But I like it even more with [`amazing_print`](https://github.com/amazing-print/amazing_print){:target="_blank"}.

So, on initialization it checks whether `irb` is running inside a Rails application or not.
If it is, it uses `bundler/inline` to install the gem. This way I do not have to add it to the `Gemfile` of projects where I work with other people.
If it is not running inside a Rails application, it installs the gem using `gem install`.

After that, it requires `amazing_print`, sets some defaults for it and initializes it.

Pretty simple, but it makes my day a little bit better.
